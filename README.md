# Model-based Detection of Software Discrimination

In this file, we presents the artifacts used in our paper, which provides a Framework for Analysing Individual Fairness based on Software Models. The artifacts include:

* the *UMLfair profile*.

*  A prototypical implementation that supports the generation of LTL claims that conform to Defenition 4.1 in our paper. 

* The inputs and the outputs of applying our proposed framework on three case studies namely, the Bank Services System based on a real case study, the Delivery Management System based on the incedent describtion of [Amazon's delivery-free service](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-amazon-same-day/), and the Loan Management System based on [business process model](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-92901-9_19) from an [event log](https://www.win.tue.nl/bpi/doku.php?id=2012:challenge) recording the loan management process of a Dutch financial institute.

The artifacts of each each case study contains: 
* a (*.uml*) file: the UML model of the system annotated with the UMLfair profile.
* Two (*.xlsx*) files. The first is the dataset, which used to uncover proxies for protected characteristics. The second file is the proxies for the protected characteristics in the model, which is used as input for our LTL claims generator.  
* a (.pml) file: the result of transforming the UML into PROMELA by using the [Hugo/RT](https://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/en/chairs/swt/sse/hugort/) tool. 
* a (*.pdf*) file: provides the generated batches of claims together with their verifications results. The verifiaction results are the output of  the [SPIN](http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html) model checker. 
* (*.trail*) files: counterexamples of violated LTL claims generated by the [SPIN](http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html) model checker.
